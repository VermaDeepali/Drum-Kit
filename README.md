# Drum-Kit

* Hey There !! Do you wanna impress your friends with your coding so I think you're at the right place.
* And also if you're a Music Lover then this is absolutely for you ;)
* Make your own Music and show them your Talent :p

-- In this project I have made a simple `Drum Kit` . And on every Drum there's a key specified so whenever you click on that or
   if you press keys from your keyboard then you're going to get a `beat` from every click or press.

## Files Included 

-`index.html` In this file I have added HTML codes.

-`styles.js` In this file I have styles for HTML codes , so that users will not get a boring layout to deal with.

-`index.js` In this file I have added JavaScript code. Beacuse of JS code we are able to play our Drums. 
            In this I have added event Listeners such that whenever you press the specified keyword you'll get a beat accordingly.
            
 ## Folders Included
 
 -`Images` In this folder I have added different images for Drums.
 
 -`Sounds` In this folder, there are sounds related to the particular Drums.

# Working : 

- In this project we have got number of keys that represents different different drums in a typical Drum Set.
- And when you click on any of these buttons you will get the corresponding sound of the Drum.
- And in addition you can also use the keys on the keyboard.
